## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds an alternate outcome to meeting Lucy, the wyvern in the Adventure Mart, and provides a resolution to the saga of the enigmatic winged creature in Ribald's store.

To access this encounter, simply talk to Lucy with your Bhaalspawn PC.


<hr>


## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, because this mod reassigns Lucy's DV, it will not be compatible with other mods that use this DV. As far as I know, there are none. The new DV is "*lucy2*". If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="www.shsforums.net/topic/33667-lucy-the-wyvern/">report them on the forum</a>!

>Although it is not required for the Lucy the Wyvern mod to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-lucy.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **lucy** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Lucy the Wyvern for BGII for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: lucy folder and a setup-lucy.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-lucy.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-lucy.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Lucy the Wyvern for BGII for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: lucy folder, setup-lucy and setup-lucy.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-lucy.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-lucy.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Lucy the Wyvern for BGII for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-lucy`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-lucy --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
